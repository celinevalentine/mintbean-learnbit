## Introduction

As the name says, the purpose of Learn-a-bit is about learning one bit of code at a time.
In these events, you will build small projects to educate yourself on the fundamentals of web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
These events are relaxed and non-competitive, but are still challenging enough to push you to use all your resources and knowledge to solve each problem.

## How does it benefit you?

Learn-a-bit will teach you the fundamentals through a hands-on approach. You will gain versatility in the basic tools of the trade and learn the best practices for writing semantic HTML and well-designed CSS. You will improve your design skills and start to create attractive and attention-grabbing portfolio pieces while also gaining confidence to tackle any of the harder hackathons.
